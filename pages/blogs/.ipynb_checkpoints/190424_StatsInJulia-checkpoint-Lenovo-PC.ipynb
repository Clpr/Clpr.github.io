    "\n",
    "In another [blog](190421_PrepareYourJuliaPkg.html) where I introduced how to prepare your Julia 1.0 for economic research, I roughly discussed the statistics/econometrics in Julia in the conclusion section.\n",
    "Though there is still a long way for Julia to go in econometrics, we can now do many fantastic jobs in statistics.\n",
    "This blog discusses how to do basic statistics in Julia 1.0.\n",
    "It depends on `JuliaStats` project and its packages. This is a project initiated by the Julia official. It is the base of the statistics in Julia language.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Section [2](#WhatPkgUsed), I provide a full list of the packages under `JuliaStats` project and some other packages. We will use these packages in this blog.\n",
    "In Section [3](#descriptivestats), I introduce how to use Julia do descriptive Statistics, e.g. histogram, QQ-plot.\n",
    "In Section [4](#distributions), I introduce how to play with many statistical distributions in Julia.\n",
    "In Section [5](#sampling), I introduce how to sampling on distributions or datasets.\n",
    "In Section [6](#hypothesistesting), I introduce how to do hypothesis tests e.g. two-sample F tests.\n",
    "In Section [7](#linearregression), I introduce how to do basic regression analysis with `MultivariateStats` and `GLM` packages.\n",
    "In Section [8](#otherstatmodels), I introduce how to do other common statistical analysis such as clustering and PCA.\n",
    "In Section [9](#econometrictopics), I discuss what other functions are required but not provided yet if we want to do more-specific econometric research, e.g. quantile regression and panel data models.\n",

    "## 2. What Packages Used? <a name=\"WhatPkgUsed\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, I talk about what packages to use in the next sections. About how to install Julia packages, please read my another [blog](190421_PrepareYourJuliaPkg.html).\n",
    "Please note, we do not use R/Python's API via `RCall`/`PyCall` (except plotting with `PyPlot`) since we are talking about the statistics in Julia.\n",
    "Meanwhile, this blog cannot cover every function of each package. Readers may be like to read these packages' documentations through searching their names on Github.\n",
    "\n",
    "`JuliaStats` is a project initiated by Julia official. Its website is: [JuliaStats.org](https://juliastats.github.io/).\n",
    "This project aims to make Julia become powerful in statistics (well ... not specially for econometrics).\n",
    "It has been the foundation of many ML/DL pacakges of Julia.\n",
    "The reason why we mainly talk about this project is that `JuliaStats` is like `SciPy` for Python or `stats` for R.\n",
    "It is expected to be the foundation of Julia statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 15 packages under `JuliaStats` project now. The following table is modified from the [documentation page](https://juliastats.github.io/) of `JuliaStats`:\n",
