    "\n",
    "In another [blog](190421_PrepareYourJuliaPkg.html) where I introduced how to prepare your Julia 1.0 for economic research, I roughly discussed the statistics/econometrics in Julia in the conclusion section.\n",
    "Though there is still a long way for Julia to go in econometrics, we can now do many fantastic jobs in statistics.\n",
    "This blog discusses how to do basic statistics in Julia 1.0.\n",
    "It depends on `JuliaStats` project and its packages. This is a project initiated by the Julia official. It is the base of the statistics in Julia language.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Section [2](#WhatPkgUsed), I provide a full list of the packages under `JuliaStats` project and some other packages. We will use these packages in this blog.\n",
    "In Section [3](#descriptivestats), I introduce how to use Julia do descriptive Statistics, e.g. histogram, QQ-plot.\n",
    "In Section [4](#distributions), I introduce how to play with many statistical distributions in Julia.\n",
    "In Section [5](#sampling), I introduce how to sampling on distributions or datasets.\n",
    "In Section [6](#hypothesistesting), I introduce how to do hypothesis tests e.g. two-sample F tests.\n",
    "In Section [7](#linearregression), I introduce how to do basic regression analysis with `MultivariateStats` and `GLM` packages.\n",
    "In Section [8](#otherstatmodels), I introduce how to do other common statistical analysis such as clustering and PCA.\n",
    "In Section [9](#econometrictopics), I discuss what other functions are required but not provided yet if we want to do more-specific econometric research, e.g. quantile regression and panel data models.\n",

    "## 2. What Packages Used? <a name = \"WhatPkgUsed\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, I talk about what packages to use in the next sections. About how to install Julia packages, please read my another [blog](190421_PrepareYourJuliaPkg.html).\n",
    "Please note, we do not use R/Python's API via `RCall`/`PyCall` (except plotting with `PyPlot`) since we are talking about the statistics in Julia.\n",
    "Meanwhile, this blog cannot cover every function of each package. Readers may be like to read these packages' documentations through searching their names on Github.\n",
    "\n",
    "`JuliaStats` is a project initiated by Julia official. Its website is: [JuliaStats.org](https://juliastats.github.io/).\n",
    "This project aims to make Julia become powerful in statistics (well ... not specially for econometrics).\n",
    "It has been the foundation of many ML/DL pacakges of Julia.\n",
    "The reason why we mainly talk about this project is that `JuliaStats` is like `SciPy` for Python or `stats` for R.\n",
    "It is expected to be the foundation of Julia statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 15 packages under `JuliaStats` project now. The following table is modified from the [documentation page](https://juliastats.github.io/) of `JuliaStats`:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Package|Task|Mainly for|\n",
    "|----|----|-----|\n",
    "|StatsBase|Basic functionalities for statistics| Descriptive statistics; sampling; ranking; weights; correlation/auto-correlation |\n",

    "|MultivariateStats|Multivariate statistical analysis | Matrix-based API for linear (e.g. LS, Lasso, Ridge) models, dimensionallity reduction, scaling, linear discriminant analysis|\n",
    "|HypothesisTests|Hypothesis tests| Parametric and Nonparametric tests|\n",
    "|MLBase| Swiss knife for machine learning| Data preprocessing; classifications; performance evaluation; model selectionn; cross-validation |\n",
    "|Distances| Various distances between vectors |  |\n",
    "|KernelDensity| Kernel density estimation| For univariate/multivariate/bivariate data; user customization of interpolation points/kernel/bandwidth |\n",
    "|Clustering| Algorithms for data clustering| K-means/medoids; Affinity propagation; Performance evaluation etc.|\n",
    "|<font color=red>GLM</font>| Generalized linear models| R-style API |\n",
    "|NMF| Nonnegative matrix factorization | NMF algorithms; NNDSVD |\n",
    "|RegERMs | Lasso/Elastic Net linear and GLMs | glmnet; polynomial trend filtering; O(n) fused Lasso; Gamma Lasso |\n",

    "I will explicitly mention what packages that a function belongs to when talking about it for the first time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, we use `PyPlot` as our visualization package, and do not use `Plots` as frontend. Matlab & Python users may see many familiar sentences.\n"

    "## 3. Descriptive Statistics <a name = \"descriptivestats\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we talk about how to use Julia to do common descriptive statistics.\n",
    "This section consists of:\n",
    "1. Making a table of descriptive statistics: `mean`, `std`, `qunatile` etc.\n",
    "2. Plotting: histogram, kernel density, QQ-plot\n",
    "3. Plotting: line, bar, scatter, box\n",
    "4. Distributions: pdf, cdf, inv-cdf, mgf (moment generating function) ...\n",
    "5. Normality tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsections 2, 3 which are about visualization are not emphasized, because they are more related to the usage of specific visualization tools (e.g. `PyPlot`) than statistical principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Making a table of descriptive statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "When introducing a dataset in paper, authors are usually required to provide a summary table like:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Variable|N| min| 25% quantile | median | mean | std | 75% quantile | max |\n",
    "|----|---|---|----|---|---|---|-----|---|\n",
    "|y| 100| -1.00 | -0.24 | -0.20 | -0.18 | 2.34 | 0.23 | 0.76 |\n",
    "|x| 100| 23.22 | 25.03 | 27.98 | 26.33 | 0.54 | 29.22| 31.43|\n",
    "\n",
    "To make such a table, readers need to learn:\n",
    "1. how to compute basic statistics, e.g. sample size, mean and std, for a single variable\n",
    "2. how to construct or format such a table\n",
    "\n",
    "For the two tasks, there may be some easy-APIs to automatically compute everything then do formatting.\n",
    "But we will finish the two jobs step by step, to get familiar with Julia's statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before Julia 0.7, common descriptive statistical methods, e.g. `mean`, are included in core Julia, which means users do not need to explicitly import/using a package to introduce them.\n",
    "But since v0.7, these functions are separated to a standard library `StatsBase`.\n",
    "(Yes, this package is one part of `JuliaStats` project)\n",
    "Now, we introduce this package then see several demos which show how to do basic statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "P.S. to explicitly display which pacakge a function belong to, we use `import` but not `using` to keep introduced packages private. But in practice, we usually `using StatsBase` to expose all exportable objects to current namespace to avoid re-writing \"StatsBase\" times by times"

    "There are several things to note:\n",
    "1. `Vector{T}` is a simple presentation of one-way array `Array{T,1}`, where `T` is a wildcard denoting \"type\" in Julia type systems. In the same way, `Matrix{T}` is the simple presentation of two-way array `Array{T,2}`. And in Julia, `Array{T,W}` can be seen as the union set of Python's list and Matlab's array. They can do list operations also linear algebra operations.\n",
    "2. finding max/min in Julia does not use `max()` and `min()` but use `findmax()` and `findmin()`. The two functions return a 2-member Tuple whose 1st member is the max/min value and the 2nd is the location of max/min in the given iterable object. By the way, `max()` and `min()` are similar to those in C/C++. They just compare two arguments and return the larger/smaller one."
