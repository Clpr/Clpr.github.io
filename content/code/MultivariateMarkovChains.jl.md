This package provides flexible API to define, approximate, manupulate, estimate and simulate multivariate (vector-valued) finite state Markov chains in discrete time. Some popular algorithms are also implemented such as Tauchen (1985) and Young (2010) non-stochastic simulation methods. It is super helpful in the parameterization of dynamic macroeconomic models as well as other generic numerical applications of stochastic analysis.
